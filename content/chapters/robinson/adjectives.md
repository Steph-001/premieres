# 🎯 Comparatives and superlatives 

---
## 📊 Quick Reference Chart

### One-Syllable Adjectives
| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| tall | tall**er** | the tall**est** |
| fast | fast**er** | the fast**est** |
| hot | hott**er** | the hott**est** |
| big | bigg**er** | the bigg**est** |

### Two or More Syllables
| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| interesting | **more** interesting | the **most** interesting |
| beautiful | **more** beautiful | the **most** beautiful |
| expensive | **more** expensive | the **most** expensive |
| intelligent | **more** intelligent | the **most** intelligent |

**👉 Rule of thumb**: If it sounds natural with *-er/-est*, use that. Otherwise, use *more/most*.

## 🎯 1. Comparatives (Comparing Two Things)

### Formation

**One-syllable adjectives**: Add **-er** + *than*  
_My car is **faster** than yours._  
_She is **taller** than her brother._

**Two+ syllables**: Use **more** + adjective + *than*  
_This book is **more interesting** than that one._  
_She is **more intelligent** than I am._

### Examples
- I'm **happier** than I was last year.
- This exercise is **easier** than the previous one.
- Your house is **more comfortable** than mine.
- My job is **less stressful** than yours.

## 👑 2. Superlatives (Comparing Three or More Things)

### Formation

**One-syllable adjectives**: Add **-est** + *the*  
_She is the **tallest** girl in the class._  
_Today is the **hottest** day of the year._

**Two+ syllables**: Use **the most** + adjective  
_This is the **most expensive** restaurant in town._  
_He is the **most talented** player on the team._

### Examples
- She has the **longest** hair in her friend group.
- That was the **best** movie I've ever seen.
- This is the **most beautiful** city I know.
- He's the **smartest** student I've taught.

## ⚠️ 3. Exceptions: Irregular Adjectives

Some common adjectives **don't follow the rules**:

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| good | **better** | the **best** |
| bad | **worse** | the **worst** |
| far | **farther/further** | the **farthest/furthest** |
| little | **less** | the **least** |
| much/many | **more** | the **most** |
| old | **older/elder*** | the **oldest/eldest*** |

*Note: *elder/eldest* is used mainly for family relationships (_my elder brother_), while *older/oldest* is more general.

### Examples
- He's a **better** teacher than he was five years ago.
- That was the **worst** experience of my life.
- The **least** expensive option is usually the best choice.
- She's **farther** along in her career than her peers.

## 🔄 4. Special Cases

### Double Comparatives (Getting More and More)
Use the **comparative twice** connected by *and*:

_She's getting **thinner** and **thinner**._  
_This situation is becoming **more and more** complicated._  
_He's becoming **better** and **better** at playing guitar._

### "The + Comparative" Construction
This means "one thing causes another":

_The **sooner** you start, the **better**._  
_The **more** you practice, the **better** you'll play._  
_The **less** you worry, the **happier** you'll be._

### Comparative with "as ... as"
To show **equality**:

_She is **as tall as** her brother._  
_This book is **as interesting as** that one._  
_He's **not as smart as** I thought._

## ✏️ 5. Spelling Changes

When adding **-er** or **-est**, watch for these patterns:

### Doubling the Final Consonant
(one vowel + one consonant at the end)
- hot → hott**er** → hott**est**
- big → bigg**er** → bigg**est**
- sad → sadd**er** → sadd**est**

### Changing y to i
(ends in consonant + y)
- happy → happi**er** → happi**est**
- easy → easi**er** → easi**est**
- friendly → friendli**er** → friendli**est**

### Dropping the e
(ends in e)
- nice → nic**er** → nic**est**
- large → larg**er** → larg**est**
- simple → simpl**er** → simpl**est**

## ✅ Summary

- **Comparatives** compare **two things** → add *-er* or use *more* + adjective + *than*
- **Superlatives** compare **three or more** → add *-est* or use *the most* + adjective
- **Watch for irregular forms**: good/better/best, bad/worse/worst
- **Spelling matters**: double consonants, y→i changes, dropping e
- **Double comparatives**: _**-er** and **-er**_ or _**more and more**_
